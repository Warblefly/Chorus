# Chorus
Massively parallel algorithmic composition tool for processing and combining large numbers of recorded sounds

For the interactive community art project and exhibition "Sway" (10th to 23rd April 2017, at O N C A Gallery, Brighton), bringing to visitors the truth about migration in the 21st century, I was asked to think about a soundtrack. My idea, based on the birdsong observations, recording and compositions of Olivier Messiaen among other great composers, was to create a unique, ever-changing soundscape based upon:

1. The genuine recorded songs of migrant birds, processed and parallelized massively in pitch, volume and time;
2. Songs of many cultures, sent to the world for teaching purposes by the British Council World Voice project
3. The contribution of gallery visitors who add new elements to a sculpture: each new element brings an addition to the soundtrack.

To this end, I have created this program that is a new musical instrument. It efficiently analyses, then processes for pitch, multi-channel pan and dynamics, very large numbers of sounds, with a minimum of human intervention. Finally, the hundreds or thousands of resultant audio files are mixed into a soundscape of almost infinite variety and interest.

The program "Chorus" is dedicated to the "SWAY" exhibition, and to all who fall into the effects of injustice as a result of migration. This includes my own family.

Chorus is released under Version 2 of the GNU General Public Licence.

You need Python 3.6 and recent FFmpeg to use this. And lots of recorded sounds. And a fast-multiprocessor computer unless you don't mind starting a process, going for a long walk, and coming back.

Version 0.9. It works.
